While at the University of Chicago, Professor Tarnopolsky was awarded the APSA Leo Strauss Award for Best Doctoral Dissertation in Political Philosophy in 2004. Prior to joining Yale-NUS, Professor Tarnopolsky’s main area of research was ancient Greek political philosophy and contemporary democratic theory, with a specific focus on the role of emotions in politics. Throughout her career, Professor Tarnopolsky has taught various courses in the history of political philosophy, all of which were focused solely on the Western canon. Professor Tarnopolsky’s desire to join Yale-NUS was motivated by a desire to learn and do research in comparative political theory and to teach a truly global curriculum. Professor Tarnopolsky’s experience in researching, designing, and teaching the Philosophy and Political Thought Course and the Modern Social Thought Course has helped her to refine these originally inchoate desires. Professor Tarnopolsky has begun to develop a research project that will compare Plato’s theories of ethical cultivation, exemplarity, and mimetic pedagogy with the theories of the ancient Confucian philosophers, Kongzi, Mengzi, and Xunzi.','marker-color': '#F7F7F7','marker-size': 'medium','marker-symbol': 'college'} },

During his doctoral research, he established a chronosequence of permanent sample plots in secondary forests in southern Mexico, which is now one of the longest-running studies on secondary forest dynamics in the Tropics. Prior to joining Yale-NUS, Dr van Breugel was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panama from 2007-2013. As part of an interdisciplinary project on the ecosystem services provided by tropical forests, he had the unique opportunity to co-lead the design and establish two of the largest long-term field studies of their kind in the Tropics. The first was a secondary forest dynamics (SFD) study in a moist and a dry agricultural landscape with 177 permanent vegetation plots. The second was a 60 hectare reforestation experiment with different combinations of native tree species with contrasting resource acquisition and use strategies. Both offered alternative approaches to quantify and scale the influence of environmental conditions, functional composition, interactions and landscape-scale processes on biodiversity and ecosystem processes and services of ‘new forests’ in human-modified landscapes. Currently, Dr van Breugel continues to co-lead the secondary forest dynamics study in Panama and takes part in the reforestation experiment. Both studies have generated an increasing number of diverse collaborations with colleagues from different disciplines. He is also involved in other ongoing studies such as one on productivity and water-use efficiency in different tree mixtures, a liana removal experiment and a nutrient addition experiment that seeks to unravel the role of nitrogen fixing trees in tropical forest succession. Dr van Breugel is in the process of setting up research in East Kalimantan and in Singapore with a range of collaborators.','marker-color': '#337AFF','marker-size': 'medium','marker-symbol': 'college'} },
